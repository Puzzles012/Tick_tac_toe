## Introduction ##
This report documents the initial design and explains the development process of the Tic-Tac-Toe browser game made by the organization Puzzle.

## Design ##
The basic design of the game is in the style of classic *Tic-Tac-Toe*. The match takes place in a 3x3 grid where the players are represented by X’s and O’s. X __always__ has the first turn. The players compete by clicking on squares to place their symbol within it. Once a player has placed their symbol in a square, the square is locked and neither he nor the opponent can place something in that square. The first player to have 3 of their symbols in a row wins. The row can be vertical, horizontal and even diagonal. Alternatively, if neither player has got 3 in a row when the board is completely filled, it is considered a draw. When either of these events happen, text will appear on the bottom of the screen, indicating who has won or whether it’s a draw. From this point on, the players can’t continue playing until they restart the game. 

We decided upon a Halloween theme for the game because of the time of year the development started and the date for the release of the game. Additionally, the demonstration will take place on the 31st of october so we felt it was appropriate to choose such a theme.
